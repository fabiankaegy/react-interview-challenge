# React Interview Challenge
This is a two hour take home coding challenge designed to test the basic principles of ReactJS and CSS. You do not have to follow the project structure given to you. Feel free to organize your project however you'd like.

## Criteria
Try and tackle as many bullet points as you can before your time is up.
